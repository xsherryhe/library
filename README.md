This project is an app that stores and displays books in a digital library. It is built using the standard front-end stack of HTML, CSS, and JS.

This branch of the project is a refactoring of the main branch using class syntax. It primarily demonstrates use of ES6 class syntax in JavaScript to create objects inherited from classes.
